                Dauin held annually in early September, coinciding with the

                Tribute to Nature, Environment & Heritage — “Kinaiyahan” means
                “nature” in Cebuano, and the festival centers on honoring the
                town’s natural resources, marine and land environments, and its
                commitment to conservation.

                Community Involvement — Local barangays, schools, and community
                groups participate enthusiastically, designing costumes, floats,
                and performances that depict themes related to nature,
                biodiversity, conservation, and local identity.
